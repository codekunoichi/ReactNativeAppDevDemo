# Pre-requisite local development setup prior to the app development

This installation guide assumes MacOS as the platform.

- Go to app store and install `XCode`
- Install homebrew locally
- Install node js and npm using `brew install node`, go get a cup of coffee while it downloads.
- Once it finishes, check the node installation using `node -v`. You will see something like `v15.2.0`
- Check the npm version using `npm -v`. You will see something like `7.0.10`
